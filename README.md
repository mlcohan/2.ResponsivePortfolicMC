## Overview

For this homework assignment, we have just learned about Bootstrap and I have created a responsive portfolio.  
I utilized the Bootstrap templetes to help me create a navbar, a card, a form and responsiveness. 

There are three html files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html` for each page. 

    Each page has a consistent navbar with my name large and responsive links to to all 3 pages, including the current page. 
    When the page is viewed at different sizes, the navbar responds.

There is a `Assets`  file containing an `Images` file and a `style.css` (not finished)

The `Images` file contains six pictures that are utilized in the `index.html` file and the `portfolio.html` file



## Details


* `index.html`
    - Repsonsive Navbar with responsive links to all 3 pages
    - Responsive Card container with `img` and title and text



* `porfolio.html`
    - Repsonsive Navbar with responsive links to all 3 pages
    - Responsive Card Container with 2 `col` and 3 `row` to display 6 `img`


* `contact.html`
    - Responsive Navbar with responsive links to all 3 pages
    - Responsive Form Container with 3 inputs, `Name`, `Email`, `Comment`

### Still need to do

* On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

* Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

### Bonus

* Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
